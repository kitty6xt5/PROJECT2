# PROJECT-2
## ***CREATING A LOAD BALANCER WITH THE HELP OF EC2 INSTANCE USING Ngnix WEB SERVER***
### ROADMAP
With the help of EC2 Instance we will create a Load Balancer using the Ngnix Web Server.
we will use three instances for checking the traffic if the Load Balancer is working correctly or not.
For data output we are using the ip of each instance in html page and different background colour of html page By which, we are able to find each instance with different colour.
